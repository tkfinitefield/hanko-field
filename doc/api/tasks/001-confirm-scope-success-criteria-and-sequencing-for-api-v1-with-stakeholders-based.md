# Confirm scope, success criteria, and sequencing for API v1 with stakeholders based on `doc/api/api_design.md`.

**Parent Section:** 0. Planning & Alignment
**Task ID:** 001

## Goal
Align stakeholders on the MVP scope of API v1 described in `doc/api/api_design.md`, enumerate assumptions, and confirm delivery order across public, user, admin, webhook, and internal surfaces.

## Outputs
- Decision log capturing agreed endpoints, deferred items, and open questions.
- Release roadmap with milestones (alpha, beta, GA) and acceptance criteria.
- RACI for API ownership (product, tech lead, QA, ops) stored in shared workspace.

## Activities
1. Facilitate kickoff workshop reviewing API surfaces and business flows (checkout, production, operations).
2. Document agreed endpoint list, priorities, and sequencing in product wiki.
3. Record cross-team dependencies (Firestore schema decisions, PSP contracts, AI models) with owners and deadlines.
4. Circulate sign-off memo summarizing plan; collect stakeholder approvals.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All teams understand build/test order and success criteria.
- Risks and assumptions catalogued with mitigation owners.
- Backlog in tracker re-prioritised to match approved plan.

## Follow-up
- Review plan in weekly delivery syncs and update document on scope changes.
- Feed sequencing into CI/CD and infrastructure schedules.
