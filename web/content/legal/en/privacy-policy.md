## Overview

This policy explains the categories of data we handle, why we process it, and how you can exercise your rights.

### Who this policy covers

- Customers using our web, admin, or API products
- Workshop partners fulfilling stamped products
- Visitors signing up for newsletters or webinars

## Data we process

We process the following categories of personal information:

1. **Account data** — names, emails, business profile, and audit logs.
2. **Production artefacts** — stamp designs, approval flows, and engraving instructions.
3. **Support interactions** — case notes, attachments, and call recordings when you contact support.

We use the data to maintain the service, comply with legal requirements, and deliver product communications you opt into.

## Retention and deletion

Retention periods differ per region. As of the latest revision we keep production artefacts for 24 months in the default region and 12 months in the EU data residency option.

When you request deletion, we anonymise audit logs and remove design artefacts within 30 days unless we must retain them for legal reasons.

## Your choices

- You can access or export your data at any time through the account portal.
- Incident notifications include a one-click unsubscribe link.
- Contact privacy@hanko-field.jp for requests about this policy.
