## Why teams choose Hanko Field

Hanko Field combines a design-forward editor with approval workflows, audit-ready histories, and localisation support. Whether you manage a startup or an international enterprise, the platform keeps every imprint consistent and accountable.

- **Design once, reuse everywhere** — build templates that match your brand grid and apply them to multiple shapes.
- **Shared governance** — issue and revoke usage rights, while every stamp impression is logged for compliance.
- **AI assistance** — transform handwritten sketches into production-ready vector seals with automatic kanji hints.

### Supported use cases

1. Department seals with scheduled maintenance windows
2. Event-specific logos with limited lifetimes
3. Legal-grade signatures for cross-border filings

## Getting started checklist

| Invite approvers | Admin | Create role groups and require two-step verification |

> Tip: use the sandbox environment to test new seal templates with simulated approvals before rolling out to production departments.
